JavaScript/TypeScript library.

     for more info
2. Replace everything contained in blocks like `${{ this }}$` with applicable
   information.

## Contributing

This template is really just my vision of how a JavaScript/TypeScript library
should be stored and built. This is the reason why I probably won't accept pull
requests to this repo, unless they fix the flaws in intended functionality.

If you still want to submit a PR, go ahead, I won't ignore it, just don't expect
me to rebuild every single of my projects according to what you think is the
best way :)
